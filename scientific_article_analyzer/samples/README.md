# Sample Article Placeholder

This directory contains sample articles for testing the scientific article analysis system.

## Files

- `input_article_1.pdf` - Sample scientific article for PDF processing test
- `sample_urls.txt` - Example URLs for web-based article processing
- `edge_case_content.txt` - Sample content outside the main scientific areas

## Usage

The test scripts will automatically create sample content if the actual PDF files are not available. In a production environment, users would place their actual scientific articles in this directory for processing.

## Note

For demonstration purposes, the system will generate representative content if the actual PDF files are not present. This ensures the tests can run successfully while demonstrating the full processing pipeline.
